* "Mobility-on-demand meets shuttles on the same mile" with my co-advisors (under review) [[SSRN](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://ssrn.com/abstract=4322824__;!!Dq0X2DkFhyF93HkjWTBQKhk!S3qO5QNKfN0EUFvWGWGk3ZVYMiA2wCI6ZW8T7HcZCIeddTbRGKT7o8S1reHZ0kXAw3x1CB9yil6MkTHCyOKE3_UrLw4azmjgSvErJFSZ--t5sKdEv9Y$)]

Short abstract: We suggest a novel way to combine static and dynamic transportation inspired by a popularly studied policy in dual sourcing in the supply chain literature. Most interestingly, we show that while hybrid policies are promising, they deviate from traditional wisdom: to decrease the passenger waiting time, the transportation planner should use fewer MoDs.


* "Did the pandemic change shopping habits at retail
stores?" with Sunil Chopra and [Ioannis Stamatopoulos](https://sites.utexas.edu/yannis-stamos/) (work in progress) [[Report](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/65570)]

Short abstract: We find empirically that at the start of the pandemic, customers traveled shorter distances, made shorter visits, and shopped more during weekdays and working hours. These changes, however, did not persist across most retail categories and customer behavior reverted to pre-pandemic patterns by 2021. The most persistent changes occurred at fast-food restaurants where the proportion of short visits under 20 minutes increased significantly and proportion of working hour visits decreased significantly.
