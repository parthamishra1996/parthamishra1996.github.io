I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Operations Management at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University co-advised by [Sunil Chopra](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/chopra_sunil.aspx), [SÃ©bastien Martin](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/martin_sebastien.aspx) and [Karen Smilowitz](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/smilowitz_karen.aspx).

My research lies broadly in transportation and retail operations. In transportation, I have been studying the interaction between static (e.g. shuttles) and dynamic (e.g. Ubers) transportation modes. I have also been interested in studying consumer behavior, in particular, the persistent operational impact of COVID-19 on consumers.
