I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Operations Management at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University co-advised by [Sunil Chopra](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/chopra_sunil.aspx), [SÃ©bastien Martin](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/martin_sebastien.aspx) and [Karen Smilowitz](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/directory/smilowitz_karen.aspx).

My research broadly lies in transportation and retail operations. In transportation, I am studying the interaction between static (e.g. buses) and dynamic (e.g. Ubers) transportation modes. In retail operations, I am interested about lasting operational impacts of COVID-19 on observed consumer behaviour.

I am also generally interested in how development of new "smarter" cities will impact transportation and retail.
