I am fourth year PhD candidate in Operations Management at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.

My research lies broadly in transportation and retail operations. In particular, I have been studying the interaction between static (e.g. shuttles) and dynamic (e.g. Ubers) transportation modes in transportation. I have also been interested in studying the persistent operational impact of COVID-19 on consumers.
